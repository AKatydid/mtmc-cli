## MTMC-CLI
MTMC-CLI is an open-source kernel generation agent based on the “Macro Thinking, Micro Coding” paradigm, running directly in your terminal. 
It provides lightweight access to macro-level reasoning and micro-level kernel coding within agent-driven loops. 

## RoadMap  
- [ ] CI Process
- [ ] Integration with automated performance evaluation and profiling tools  
- [ ] Multi-backend kernel generation (e.g., CUDA, Triton, other accelerators)  
- [ ] Benchmarking and reproducibility utilities for generated kernels

## Acknowledge
MTMC-CLI is inspired by the excellent open-source project **[google-gemini/gemini-cli](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli)**.  
We thank the Gemini CLI team for providing a clean and well-designed foundation for building agent-driven CLI tools.
